      <title>Create smoother animations with animation-fill-mode</title>

      <description>What is animation-fill-mode? animation-fill-mode is a CSS property which tells an animation how to apply styles to the target element before or after it is run.
In this post we will be focussing on the use of the value animation-fill-mode: forwards, This value allows the target element to maintain the styles applied in the final keyframes of it&amp;rsquo;s animation.
Why is this so good? When you use animation-fill-mode: forward you can set the initial styles of elements to be hidden or offscreen and then use the styles in your keysframes to determine the final state of your UI.</description>
