      <description>Requirements Grow2 required a suite of applications to run on desktop and mobile for both adminstrators (content creators) and the people receiving the material.
The point was made early on by the team at Grow2 that everybody had to have the ability to learn in their preferred way. Some people preferred reading content, some prefer a video, others enjoy listening to audio. This meant we would need to take advantage of cloud hosting using Amazon AWS S3.</description>
