      <description>Design at DCUBED is done very different to how things typically play out at other agencies. We have figured out over the years that the quicker we learn about a design, the more success we have with it. And there is no way faster way to get your hands on a design than through code.
Our proficiency with CSS and other front end languages means that once we move past a &amp;ldquo;white board sesh&amp;rdquo;, we&amp;rsquo;re ready to start bringing our ideas to life.</description>

      <description>Design Sprints App design If you have your own development team and just need someone who can help you untangle your thoughts and visually bring them to life, we can also help with this. Fortunately, we speak the same language developers do, so we can make sure that we create achievable designs and work with your team to execute. We can deliver design assets in any format that suits you needs, PDF, Sketch files or via design platform tools like inVision.</description>
