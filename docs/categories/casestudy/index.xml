      <description>Beachside vibes for Beachside Bargains Beachside Bargains already had a good looking logo to work with that allowed us to seamlessly integrate a beachy vibe with bold and vibrant colours. As you scroll on both mobile and desktop it transitions the sky from a sunny blue horizon into a beautiful orange sunset, while the logo sets in the background. Gorgeous!
The website is clearly a mobile-first design with the call to actions positioned perfectly near those eager thumbs.</description>

      <description>Requirements FinX is a finance solutions company that offers financial services to customers looking to purchase vehicles, equipment, marine, caravans and other commercial goods.
At the time FinX did not have a website to direct potential customers to and therefor needed one built, asap.
The primary goal of this new website will be to generate leads as well as provide an online presence.
Responsive website The new landing page is a ‘responsive’ website.</description>

      <description>Requirements Grow2 required a suite of applications to run on desktop and mobile for both adminstrators (content creators) and the people receiving the material.
The point was made early on by the team at Grow2 that everybody had to have the ability to learn in their preferred way. Some people preferred reading content, some prefer a video, others enjoy listening to audio. This meant we would need to take advantage of cloud hosting using Amazon AWS S3.</description>
