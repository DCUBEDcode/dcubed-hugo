### Design Sprints

DCUBED can facilitate or train teams on how to run design sprints is a five day process for validating ideas and solving big challenges through prototyping and testing ideas with customer

### App design

If you have your own development team and just need someone who can help you untangle your thoughts and visually bring them to life, we can also help with this.Fortunately, we speak the same language developers do, so we can make sure that we create achievable designs and work with your team to execute.  We can deliver design assets in any format that suits you needs, PDF, Sketch files or via design platform tools like inVision.

### Prototyping

A step further from the design stage, prototyping is often super important to help you learn what works and
what doesnâ€™t work with your product.
