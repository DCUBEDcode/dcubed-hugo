Design at DCUBED is done very different to how things typically play out at
other agencies. We have figured out over the years that the quicker we learn
about a design, the more success we have with it. And there is no way faster
way to get your hands on a design than through code.

Our proficiency with CSS and other front end languages means that once we move
past a "white board sesh", we're ready to start bringing our ideas to life.
This means we get things closer to their final form (in a web browser) sooner
rather than later. Now we can play with the design on our mobiles, ipads, or
laptops and reveal any roadbumps that don't play out in the perfect Figma or
Sketch files we have.

Our 'typical' design process would like something like this.

## Design Sprints

We run many variations of Design Sprints which focus on rapid concept
generation, critique and collectively commit to an idea. These can run anywhere
between 2-5 days and generally depend on atleast 3 people from both DCUBED and
the client. Preferrably the partipants should come from different disciplines
so that the perspectives (content, technical, business) remain diverse.

The output of the Design Sprints are often physical pieces of butcher paper or
the like which will have little sketches all saying the same thing after the amalgamation of everyones ideas. From
here we're ready to bring these ideas to life.

### App design

If you have your own development team and just need someone who can help you untangle your thoughts and visually bring them to life, we can also help with this.Fortunately, we speak the same language developers do, so we can make sure that we create achievable designs and work with your team to execute.  We can deliver design assets in any format that suits you needs, PDF, Sketch files or via design platform tools like inVision.

### Prototyping

A step further from the design stage, prototyping is often super important to help you learn what works and
what doesnâ€™t work with your product.
