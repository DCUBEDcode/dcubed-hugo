## Progressive Web Apps (PWA)

<div class="grid grid--50">
  <div class="grid-col">
    Everyone knows the stats - mobile phone usage has long surpassed desktop usage on the web. This is why we
    believe it’s critical that the experience on the mobile web must look and feel just as good as their native app
    counterparts.</p><p>With Progressive Web Apps this is possible - these types of app offer offline
    capabilities, installation to homescreen, notifications and plenty more. Taking this approach to mobile development means that the phone is no longer and after thought.</p>

## Websites

If your business needs a website that needs to do a little more heavy lifting than just a simple Wordpress
site with a simple contact form and an image gallery then you’ve come to the right place. Our team has years
of experience creating and maintaining robust websites that handle millions of requests a day.
We specialise in creating websites that take advantage of more advanced features such as - multi-level
account systems, email notifications, Stripe integration and payment gateways, file upload which take
advantage of Amazon Web Services such as S3.

## Search Engine Optimisation (SEO)

SEO used to get a bad wrap but now as Google is more transparent with what
they're looking for, if you know what they want it makes things a lot more
predictable. At DCUBED we look to create landing pages for your website that increase traffic and increase conversion.
