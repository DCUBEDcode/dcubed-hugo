## Progressive Web Apps (PWA)

Everyone knows the stats - mobile phone usage has long surpassed desktop usage on the web. This is why we
believe it’s critical that the experience on the mobile web must look and feel just as good as their native app
counterparts.

With Progressive Web Apps this is possible - these types of app offer offline
capabilities, installation to homescreen, notifications and plenty more. Mobile development is not just an after thought for us. 

## Websites

If your business needs a website that needs to do a little more heavy lifting than just a simple Wordpress
site with a simple contact form and an image gallery then you’ve come to the right place. Our team has years
of experience creating and maintaining robust websites that handle millions of requests a day.
We specialise in creating websites that take advantage of more advanced features such as - multi-level
account systems, email notifications, Stripe integration and payment gateways, file upload which take
advantage of Amazon Web Services such as S3.

## Search Engine Optimisation (SEO)

Our team are big believers in the power of the web. We love the accessibility, the speed of development and
we are constantly blown away every day by the things we see being built.
