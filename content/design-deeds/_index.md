The website build will be **streamed on Twitch**. People will be able to donate money to the chosen applicant via the stream. You can follow the [Twitch page](https://www.twitch.tv/dcubedau) now to be notified when the stream is starting.

## Why make stuff for free?

- I want to help. If people need something that I can offer right now and it will make a positive change to their situation, then why not.
- I want to teach. People who might be out of work and want to learn new stuff. Maybe they are inspired to learn more and go into the industry.
- It will be a lot of fun.

## What kind of website?

The website build goes for two days and in this time I will be coming up with the design, content strategy, information architecture and of course writing code. Since there is a short time and a big lot to get through, the website must be of reasonable size with humble features. This doesn't mean we can't make magic! Here are some that could work:

<h4 class="flat">Artist page</h4>
<p>One pager with images, instagram feed and contact details</p>

<h4 class="flat">Brochure style site</h4>
<p>3-4 page website about your business including home page and contact form</p>

<h4 class="flat">Microsite</h4>
<p>Perhaps a larger organisation doing good stuff and you need a microsite made for a campaign made</p>

## Apply

If you, your company or anyone you know would benefit from the above then please use the following form to apply. Simply explain how you or someone you know has been affected and how a website could help the situation.

### Terms & Conditions:

1. All IP including design assets, code, concepts will belong to the chosen applicant.
2. There will be no requirement what so ever to continue engagement with DCUBED for any support work. If you want to then of course we can arrange but it is not expected.
3. No reselling any design assets / code made by DCUBED.
4. The design and website provided will not be accepting feedback or revisions. DCUBED will make sure to ask the right questions before kick off so you get what you want.
