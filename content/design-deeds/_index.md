The website build will be **streamed on Twitch**. You can follow the [Twitch page](https://www.twitch.tv/dcubedau) now to be notified when the stream is starting. Those watching and learning from the build can donate money to the chosen person/organization via the stream.

## Why make stuff for free?

- We want to help. If people need something that we can offer right now and it will make a positive change to their situation, then why not. We all need each other now more than ever.
- We want to teach and share our expertise. People who might be out of work and want to learn new stuff. It might inspire them to learn more and perhaps get into the industry.
- It will be a lot of fun.

## What kind of website?

The website build goes for two days and in this time I will be coming up with the design, content strategy, information architecture and, of course, be writing code. Becuase this is such a short time and a lot to get through, the website must be of reasonable size with basic features. This doesn't mean we can't make magic! Here are some ideas that could work:

<h4 class="flat">Artist page</h4>
<p>One pager with images, instagram feed and contact details</p>

<h4 class="flat">Brochure style site</h4>
<p>3-4 page website about your business including home page and contact form</p>

<h4 class="flat">Microsite</h4>
<p>Perhaps a larger organisation already with a web presence and you need a microsite made for a campaign or a special project</p>

## Apply

If you, your company or anyone you know would benefit from the above then please use the following form to apply. Simply explain how you or someone you know has been affected and how a website could help the situation.
