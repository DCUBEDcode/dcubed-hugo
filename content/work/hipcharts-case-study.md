## What's your top 5?

Are you one of those people who are just so passionate about their music that they feel they need to document their favourite tracks by an artist and let everyone know about it? Well Hipcharts aims to give you that power by allowing you to create your own charts of your top 5 favourite songs by any artist.

## Powered by Spotify

Spotify not only has one of the largest collections of music metadata but it opens up personalisation within an app when used for authentication. Users can simply sign in with their Spotify credentials and are presented with a list of their top artists. This means they are just a few taps away from creating and sharing charts with their friends.

## Editing and sharing your charts

The chart editing interface uses a simple drag and drop function to move songs around in the order that suits you. Because trust us when we say, it's no easy task to lock in the final track order for a particular artist. The first five tracks may come to mind quickly, but being able to say which one you like better than the other is tough! Once you finally decide it's time to share. Sharing can be done directly through Facebook which creates a post on your behalf with an server rendered image of your published chart as well as a link back to the chart. There is also the option to save the image to your phone and manually post to Instagram, as they unfortunately do not provide an official sharing API (they say this is to hold up the integrity of the photo quality within their app).

## The future of Hipcharts

Hipcharts plans to continue building out functionality allowing users to vote on other users charts. These scores will be tallied and a section will be added within the app where the most popular charts as voted by Hipcharts users is available for everyone to see. Further integration with Spotify to preview tracks is also coming in the next release.
