Design at DCUBED is done very different to how things typically play out at
other agencies. We have figured out over the years that the quicker we learn
about a design, the more success we have with it. And there is no way faster
way to get your hands on a design than through code.

Our proficiency with CSS and other front end languages means that once we move
past a "white board sesh", we're ready to start bringing our ideas to life.
This means we get things closer to their final form (in a web browser) sooner
rather than later. Now we can play with the design on our mobiles, ipads, or
laptops and reveal any roadbumps that don't play out in the perfect Figma or
Sketch files we have.

**Our 'typical' design process would like something like this:**

## Step 1: Design Sprints

We run many variations of Design Sprints which focus on rapid concept
generation, critique and collectively commit to an idea. These can run anywhere
between 2-5 days and generally depend on atleast 3 people from both DCUBED and
the client. Preferrably the partipants should come from different disciplines
so that the perspectives (content, technical, business) remain diverse.

The output of the Design Sprints are often physical pieces of butcher paper or
the like which will have little sketches all saying the same thing after the amalgamation of everyones ideas. From here we're ready to bring these ideas to life.

## Step 2: Protyping / UI Design

Using the sketches from the Design Studio we now start turning the ideas on
paper into workflows and interfaces within the web browser. You don't get any
higher fidelity design than you do in it's final form :sunglasses:

As we are testing while we go, we weed out any obvious issues with the sketches
once they are translated to the browser. Once we have a working
prototype it's now on to testing internally or externally depending on how
brave you are.

## Step 3: User testing

User testing comes in many different flavours, the approach taken ultimately
comes down to budget and the maturity of the product.

If we are designing a brand new product we like to get the prototypes in front
of the target market as soon as possible to make sure the product fits.
Otherwise, if this is an existing product but perhaps a new feature, then there
is opportunities for A/B testing with their existing customer base.

If none of the above, we continue to test the product internally and with any
relevant stakeholders to prove that our designs work. We repeat the design and
test process until we think we've got it right.

## Step 4: Development and polish

After the design figures itself out, we can now commit to writing any backend
code needed to power the app as well as polish off any parts of the design that
need love.
